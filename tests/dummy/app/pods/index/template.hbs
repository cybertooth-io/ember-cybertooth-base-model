    <p>
      This Ember Addon provides you a base Ember Data model that includes
      the <code>createdAt</code> & <code>updatedAt</code> model attributes, which
      coincidentally matches the column names that <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>
      automatically appends to your models.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also provide a number of extended helper computed properties that allow you
      to query your model about its state. Lastly, we have a serializer that you can
      attach to your application serializer so that your `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
      attributes aren't passed into your POST/PUT actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This addon pairs nicely with Mike North's
      <a href="https://github.com/mike-north/ember-api-actions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ember-api-actions</a>
      as we provide some helper methods that allow you to transition between the different Ember Data
      model states. Be sure to check out the benefits page contained within.
